We present a curriculum for a diversity-promoting professional 
development course for future college instructors. We implemented 
the curriculum in both in-person and online formats. Weekly class 
meetings focused on activities and discussions of teaching practices 
that encourage and support the increasingly diverse student body in 
higher education. Activities included teaching of strategies to combat 
microaggressions in real time. By targeting our classes at current graduate 
students who wish to become professors, we aim to effect institutional change 
over many years. We conclude the presentation with lessons learned and 
future directions.
